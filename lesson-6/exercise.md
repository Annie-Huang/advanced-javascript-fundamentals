## Exercise #1

- The first problem you are tasked is to simply "make it work". You'll notice a couple of `console.log`s at the bottom of the exercise code that print out the desired results. Using the bare-bones implementation of the code, try to figure out how to make the `console.log`s actually print out what they say they should print out.

- Make sure that the second class `BiggerTriple`'s triple function utilizes the triple function of  `Triple`

## Exercise #2

- The second exercise is a working code snippet involving two classes. You tasked to have the code return the same `console.log` result by "de-sugaring" the class into functions and prototypes. I taught that classes were simply sugar over functions and things like the `extends` keyword was setting prototypes equal to other functions / objects. So take a look at the code and convert it to functions, objects, etc. Make the `console.log` at the bottom of the code snippet return the same result.
