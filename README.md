# Advanced Javascript Fundamentals

✌️Hello! My name is Tyler Clark and this is the
source material for my Advanced JS Fundamentals workshop

## Pre-Workshop Instructions/Requirements

This workshop is helpful for developers at any level of their career. Though it assumes that you have at a minimum a basic knowledge of JavaScript such as its syntax

- [ ] Setup the project (follow the setup instructions below)
- [ ] Install and setup [Zoom](https://zoom.us) on the computer you will be using

## Workshop Outline

While there are similarities between each lesson, we will work through each exercise independent of each other.

1. Primitive Types, the What, How, and Why
2. Understanding Implicit vs Explicit Coercion
3. How Prototypal Inheritance Works in JS
4.  Create New Objects with the New Keyword
5. Reference Execution with the `this` Keyword
6. Understand Lexical vs. Dynamic Scope
7.  Infinitely Loop with Recursion
8. Use the ES6 Class Keyword
9.  Hoisting Variables with Const, Let, Var
10. Hide Variables with Closures
11. Create an Immediately Invoked Function (IIFE)
12. Utilize Date and Math Objects
13. Understanding Strict Mode

## System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) v2 or greater

Git must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path]

## Setup

You can work through these exercises through the browser if you want. This is nice because you do not need to clone the repo and set it up on your machine.

To work in the browser, go to
[this codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/twclark0/advanced-javascript-fundamentals)

[![Edit advanced-javascript-fundamentals](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/twclark0/advanced-javascript-fundamentals)

If you'd rather be able to work through the workshop on your own computer clone this repo to your machine.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/twclark0/advanced-javascript-fundamentals.git

cd advanced-javascript-fundamentals

```

## Working through it

I will have at least one exercise for each lesson. All of the exercises will be in the `exercises` directory. At the top of each exercise is a description of what the current state of the code is in and what the goal state is supposed to look like. So before you have any questions please make sure you have read the description at the top of the file thoroughly.

As you will see, there is a directory called `exercises-completed` that shows the final "answer" to each exercise question.
